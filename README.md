## Process
    
I started out by writing the HTML and CSS of my website. Then I played around with the API to see what calls it would make. Next I discovered how to make a nested API call, since the UV index depends on the first call. My biggest problem that arose was how to call using both the search bar and the search history buttons, which I solved with an if statement.
